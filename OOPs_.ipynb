Abstraction simplifies the view of an object.\n",

It's about protecting the data from external access and modification, ensuring that the data can only be accessed or changed through the object's methods. This prevents accidental or unauthorized changes to the data. Think of a capsule containing medicine: the medicine is enclosed within the capsule, and you interact with the medicine by taking the capsule.

        "* Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and is important for several key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Flexibility and Extensibility:** Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform way. This means you can design functions or methods that operate on objects of a superclass, and they will automatically work correctly with objects of any subclass that overrides the relevant methods. This makes your code much more flexible and easier to extend in the future. You can add new subclasses without having to modify the existing code that uses the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Code Reusability:** With polymorphism, you can write generic code that can be reused for different types of objects. Instead of writing separate functions for each class, you can write one function that takes an object of the superclass type (or an object that adheres to a certain interface/protocol) and relies on the polymorphic behavior of the methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Simplified Code:** Polymorphism can lead to simpler and more readable code. Instead of using conditional statements (like `if-elif-else`) to check the type of an object and call the appropriate method, you can simply call the same method on different objects, and the correct implementation will be executed automatically through polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Maintainability:** Because polymorphism promotes code reusability and reduces the need for conditional logic based on type, it makes your codebase easier to maintain. Changes to the implementation of a specific subclass's method don't require changes in the code that calls that method polymorphically.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Abstraction:** Polymorphism works hand-in-hand with abstraction. By interacting with objects through a common interface (defined in the superclass or through duck typing), you abstract away the specific implementation details of the subclasses. This allows you to focus on \"what\" the objects do rather than \"how\" they do it.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Improved Design:** Polymorphism encourages better object-oriented design. It promotes the idea of designing classes based on their behaviors rather than just their data. This leads to more modular and well-structured code.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Modularity:** OOP allows you to break down a complex problem into smaller, self-contained objects. Each object represents a distinct entity with its own data and behavior. This modularity makes the code easier to understand, manage, and debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Code Reusability:** Through inheritance, you can create new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes. This eliminates the need to rewrite the same code multiple times, saving development time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Maintainability:** OOP code is generally easier to maintain. Because objects are self-contained and interactions between them are well-defined, changes made within one object are less likely to affect other parts of the system. This simplifies debugging and updating the codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Flexibility and Extensibility:** Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types in a uniform way. This makes your code more flexible and easier to extend with new features or classes without modifying existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Improved Design:** OOP encourages a more organized and structured approach to software design. By modeling real-world entities as objects, you can create a more intuitive and understandable representation of the problem domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Abstraction:** OOP supports abstraction, which allows you to hide complex implementation details and expose only the essential features of an object. This simplifies the user's interaction with the object and reduces complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **Easier Debugging:** Due to the modular nature of OOP, isolating and debugging errors becomes easier. You can focus on individual objects or classes to identify and fix issues.\n",
        "\n",

        "* Here's why `super()` is important:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Calling Parent Class Methods:** The most common use of `super()` is to call a method from the parent class within the child class. This is often done in the `__init__` method to ensure that the parent class's initialization is performed, but it can be used with any method.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Supporting Multiple Inheritance and MRO:** In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from multiple parent classes. The Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. `super()` correctly navigates the MRO to find the appropriate method in the parent class(es), even in complex inheritance scenarios. This avoids issues that can arise from explicitly calling parent methods by name, especially in diamond inheritance structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Code Maintainability:** Using `super()` makes your code more maintainable. If you change the name of the parent class, you don't need to update the child class's method calls if you used `super()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Flexibility:** `super()` allows for more flexible and dynamic inheritance. It works correctly even if the inheritance hierarchy changes.\n",

        "\n",
        "* In Python, the `__del__` method, also known as the **destructor**, is a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. Its primary significance is to allow you to define cleanup actions that should be performed when an object is no longer needed and its memory is being reclaimed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Here's what you need to know about `__del__`:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Purpose:** The main purpose of `__del__` is to release external resources that the object might be holding. This could include closing file handles, network connections, database connections, or releasing locks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **When it's Called:** `__del__` is not guaranteed to be called immediately when an object is no longer referenced. Python's garbage collector determines when objects are no longer reachable and decides when to reclaim their memory. This means that `__del__` might be called at an unpredictable time, or not at all if the program exits before the garbage collector runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Not Always Necessary:** In many cases, you don't need to define a `__del__` method. Python's garbage collector is usually sufficient for managing memory. For resource management, it's often better to use context managers (`with` statement) or explicit cleanup methods, as they provide more deterministic control over resource release.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Potential Issues:** Using `__del__` can sometimes lead to complications, especially in complex object graphs or with circular references. If an object with a `__del__` method is part of a reference cycle, it might not be garbage collected, and `__del__` might never be called.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Syntax:** The `__del__` method takes only one argument, `self`.\n",

        "\n",
        "3.  **Method Overriding:** In each derived class, you can redefine the method with the same name and signature as the one in the base class. The implementation in the derived class provides a specialized behavior for that specific type of object.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Polymorphic Behavior:** When you have a collection or a variable that can hold objects of the base class or any of its derived classes, you can call the overridden method on these objects. Python's runtime will automatically determine the actual type of the object and execute the correct version of the method (the one defined in the object's specific class).\n",
